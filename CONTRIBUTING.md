# Contributing to Awesome Kafka Resources

Thanks for considering a contribution! This guide ensures quality and consistency.

## Submission Criteria

### Tools and Libraries

To add a tool or library, it must meet **at least one** of these criteria:

1. **Community adoption**: 50+ GitHub stars OR documented production usage
2. **Active maintenance**: Commit activity in the last 6 months
3. **Unique value**: Solves a problem not covered by existing tools
4. **Wide usage**: Referenced in multiple public Kafka deployments/talks/blogs

### Documentation and Guides

- Must be publicly accessible
- Should be current (published/updated in last 2 years)
- Provides practical value (not just marketing)

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Add your tool** to the appropriate section in README.md
3. **Follow the existing format**:
   ```markdown
   - :green_heart:[Tool Name](https://github.com/org/repo)
     ![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/org/repo?style=social)
     ![Forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/org/repo?style=social)
     - Brief description (1-2 sentences, focus on what it does).
   ```
4. **Keep descriptions objective**: No marketing fluff, just facts
5. **Check for duplicates**: Search existing entries first
6. **Open a pull request** with:
   - Clear title: "Add [Tool Name]"
   - Why it belongs here (stars/usage/value)
   - Link to proof of adoption (if applicable)

## What Gets Rejected

- Self-promotion without proven adoption
- Abandoned projects (no commits in 2+ years)
- Duplicate functionality without clear differentiation
- Tools unrelated to Kafka ecosystem
- Marketing content disguised as documentation
- Non-English documentation (main content must be in English)

## Style Guidelines

- **Descriptions**: Short, direct, no hype. "Modern CLI for Kafka" not "Revolutionary game-changing CLI"
- **Ordering**: Alphabetical within subsections where possible
- **Badges**: Use GitHub's shields.io badges for stars/forks
- **Links**: Direct to GitHub repo or official site (not Medium posts or personal blogs)

## Maintenance Contributions

We welcome help with:

- Updating stale links
- Removing abandoned projects
- Improving descriptions
- Adding missing popular tools
- Fixing typos and formatting

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. No spam. No self-promotion without merit. Focus on helping the Kafka community.
